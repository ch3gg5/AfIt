# 🗺️ AfIt Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for **AfIt**, an open-source, AI-powered nutrition and wellness tracker. The roadmap is divided into three main phases:

- ✅ **Current (Done / In Progress)**  
- 🔜 **Near-Term Goals (Planned)**  
- 🔍 **Long-Term Vision (Future Expansion)**  

A roadmap helps users and contributors understand the project's direction and what they can expect in future releases. This is a **living document** — it will be updated regularly as features are completed or new ideas emerge.
